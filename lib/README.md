# Libraries used by XLParser

This directory contains the libraries used by XLParser.
Every library must be provided as:

1. Source files if available, preferably as a git submodule
2. A release build .dll for easy setup, either directly in the lib folder or inside the project folder. For the latter make sure to add that file to this folder's .gitignore file.
